# intents-editor-app
The Intents Editor app is a multiplatform app that allows the user to
edit Intents for bots. The app runs on:

- Windows 32 and 64 bit
- OS/X (you must supply your own signing keys)
- Linux (using Wine)

Platforms that may be added in the future:

- Android
- iOS (including iPhones and iPads)

It is written in Delphi (Object Pascal) and requires RAD Studio Delphi from Embarcadero,
version 10.4.2 as of this writing.

We do not support RAD Studio or the Object Pascal language, it is assumed that you know how to use it or can teach yourself to do so. If you don't have the IDE/compiler, download the community version here:

Note that it only runs under Windows. It will not run under Wine on Linux. It is free to use for non-commercial purposes or commercial up to $5000 revenue.

If you wish to contribute to the project, fork the repo, make your changes and submit
them as a pull request for consideration. This is a fairly simple app, so it should be
easy for you to modify it for your needs if you feel it necessary.
